Note: I worked on this project alone so all that can be found inside the source of the game sent for the Game Submission is my work.
Citations can be found inside References.txt inside the same folder as this file.

I have added a lot of things from the source in the "Additional" folder.
It is not needed to check that folder if my source folder I sent for the other part of the
assignment will be taken into consideration.
