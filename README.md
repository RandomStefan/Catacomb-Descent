Make your way out of the dungeon by eliminating the enemies or escaping their attacks. Face a stong final enemy and exit the dungeon !

The secret level is hidden after a big jump at the start of the game:

Completing the secret level reduces the cooldowns of your abilities !

The game's tutorial introduces the player to the mechanics needed to complete the level.
The tutorial consists of floating text in the game world followed by a part where the usage of the
